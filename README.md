**URL**: `/quote`  
**Method**: `GET`  
**Description**: Returns a random motivational quote in JSON format.

### 1. How to **Request Data** from the Microservice

To request data from the **Quote Microservice**, you will need to make an HTTP `GET` request to the `/quote` endpoint. You can do this from any programming language that supports HTTP requests. You need to make sure the microservice is running before sending the request.

#### Example Request in **Python** (using `requests` library):

```python
import requests

# Make a GET request to the quote microservice
response = requests.get("http://127.0.0.1:5000/quote")

```
The URL http://127.0.0.1:5000/quote refers to the endpoint exposed by the microservice.

127.0.0.1 is the loopback address, which means the service is running on the same machine as the test program.
5000 is the port number that the Flask web server is likely listening on (this is common for Flask applications by default).
/quote is the route/endpoint the service provides that returns a random quote (as described).

### 2. How to **Receive Data** from the Microservice

Once you've sent a request to the `/quote` endpoint, the **Quote Microservice** will respond with a **JSON-formatted** object that contains a random quote. Below is a detailed description of how to receive and handle this data in your application.

#### Example Response Format:

The server will respond with a JSON object containing the quote. A typical response looks like this:

```json
{
    "quote": "The only way to do great work is to love what you do. â€“ Steve Jobs"
}
```
The JSON object has a single key:

    "quote": A string containing the random motivational quote.

#### Example in **Python** (using `requests` library):

Below is an example of how you can **receive and parse the data** from the microservice in Python using the `requests` library:

```python

# Check if the request was successful (status code 200)
if response.status_code == 200:
    # Parse the JSON response and extract the quote
    data = response.json()
    
    # Access the quote from the response and print it
    print("Random Quote:", data["quote"])
else:
    # Handle unsuccessful requests (non-200 status codes)
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}")
```
